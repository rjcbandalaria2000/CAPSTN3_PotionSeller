  dialogueTitle: Selling Potion
  dialogues:
  - It's time to go back to the <b>[Order Area]</b>. Let's select the potion we crafted
    to sell them.
  - The price we see right now is the base price of the potion.  It covers the gold
    that we used to buy the ingredients awhile ago.
  - We can then add <b>[mark-up]</b> to the base price so we will gain profit. Just
    watch out that we do not overprice the potion or our customers won't buy them.
