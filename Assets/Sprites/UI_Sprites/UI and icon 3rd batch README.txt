UI_and_icons_3rd_batch: Sample placement will be on ppt slides

New Screen (overlay of border only or 70% transparency; whichever works better).  Can still use the original one (100% trans)


Completion Meter (3, 4, or 6 parts; full and empty): use it for indicator of how many swipes/tapping needed -  
(3 parts means = 3 taps) or (6 parts to 3 taps and 3 swipes; half and half)
   > grind icon (tap the icon; or can also not be implemented: player can tap anywhere in the screen or press spacebar)


Order Letter: add random words then highlight keywords with (red or pink color)


Potion Icons: for potion select interface


Potion: ignore this for now. (but it can be the alt for the order, instead of text; sample is also in the ppt)


Timing Meter: (cut in parts): I included a sample for guide.
   > hit line: 2 variations: [1] cyan only (simple hit) or [2] cyan and white (hit line has good or perfect hit line)


! icon: appears when a new owl (customer appears): added indicator.
